#Angular Services
This is the code repository for [Angular Services](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angular-services?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785882616), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
A primary concern with modern day applications is that they need to be dynamic, and for that, data access from the server side, data authentication, and security are very important. Angular leverages its services to create such state-of-the-art dynamic applications.

This book will help you create and design customized services, integrate them into your applications, import third-party plugins, and make your apps perform better and faster. This book starts with a basic rundown on how you can create your own Angular development environment compatible with v2 and v4. You will then use Bootstrap and Angular UI components to create pages. You will also understand how to use controllers to collect data and populate them into NG UIs.


##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
#import packages into the project
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  from urllib.request import urlopen
import pandas as pd
```

A usual front-end development machine with basic hardware configuration, plus latest
stable versions of NodeJS, WebStorm and official Angular seed project is all you need to
follow along and implement the concepts introduced in each chapter. The seed project in
chapter one, contains all you need to get started. Later in the following chapters, you will
need a cloud account (Google account) to benefit from CSE (Custom Search Engine) and
Firebase.
